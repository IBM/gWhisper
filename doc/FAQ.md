# Frequently asked Questions

### Why is tab completion not working?
Maybe you forgot to install or source the completion files, or forgot to restart your shell after installing gWhisper.

### Why don't you use JSON for input?
The main reason is usability. As JSON uses characters also used by shells (mostly `}{"`), inputing an encoded datastructure would then require heavy escaping/quoting of those characters.

### Why don't you use JSON for output?
JSON is _semi_-human readable, however we found out that some aids can make datastructures even more readable, but are not possible in JSON:
- Horizontal guides indicating level of indentation for nested types instead of brackets.
- Vertical guides from identifier to value.
- Type information
- Colors

In the end we decided that machine-readability of gWhisper output is not really in the scope of gWhisper as a CLI debug tool. If we find out this functionality is really needed, we might add a flag to change this behavior

### What if my server does not support reflection?
Currently your server needs to have reflection enabled.  
However we are working on a solution to load grammar from protofiles instead from reflection API.

### Why didn't you implement a sub-shell to get rid of escaping and shell compatibility problems?
We think that sub-shells ruin the experience. A small debugging tool should be controllable directly from the shell. So we decided to go the extra mile and find out how to dynamically pass completions into bash/fish. (Yes we had a lot of problems with arguments being tokenized)
