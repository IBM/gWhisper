gWhisper - A gRPC command-line client
https://github.com/IBM/gWhisper

This command allows to call gRPC RPCs on any gRPC server with reflection enabled.
You may use TAB completion for all arguments (currently only supported in BASH).

SYNOPSIS:
gwhisper [OPTIONS] <hostname>[:port] <service> <method> [<fieldName>=FIELD_VALUE ]...

client-streaming RPCs:
gwhisper [OPTIONS] <hostname>[:port] <service> <method> [:[<fieldName>=FIELD_VALUE ]...:]...

The default TCP port used to connect to a gRPC server is 50051.

OPTIONS:

 General options:

   -h
   --help
       Shows this help and exits.

   --version
       Prints version information and exits.

 Behavioral options:

   --complete[=DIALECT]
       Shows possible next arguments and exits.
       DIALECT selects how suggections are formatted. Usually dialects customize
       the printed suggestions to be compatible with the completion API of a
       given shell.
       Currently two dialects are supported:
         fish: compatible putput for the fish 'complete' command
         bash: compatible output for the bash 'complete' command
       If no DIALECT is specified 'bash' is used as a default.

   --connectTimeoutMilliseconds=TIMEOUT_VALUE
       Default: 500
       Sets the timeout for the gRPC Channel to go into connected state. If the
       channel is not in connected state after the specified timeout, the gRPC
       call and reflection-based completion attempts are aborted.


 Output formatting options:

   --noColor
       Disables colors in the output of gRPC replies.
       NOTE: colors are automatically disabled when gwhisper is outputting
       into a pipe.

   --color
       Enables colors also in pipes.

   --noSimpleMapOutput
       Disable the map outputted as "key => value" of gRPC replies.

   --customOutput OUTPUT_FORMAT
       Instead of printing the reply message using the default human readable
       format, a custom format as specified in OUTPUT_FORMAT is used.
       See OUTPUT_FORMAT section for a description of the OUTPUT_FORMAT language.
       Note: This is an experimental feature and will be documented in detail,
       once finished.

 Debug options:

   --dot
       Prints a graphviz digraph, representing the current grammar of the parser.

   --printParsedMessage
       Prints the parsed request message in a human readable format before calling
       the remote procedure.

   --debugComplete
       Prints debug information about completion (might only be useful if
       --complete is also present).

FIELD_VALUE:
  Field values in the request message may be specified as follows
  - integers:
      decimal (e.g. 46, -46, +46)
      hexadecimal (e.g. 0x45ab, -0x45ab, +0x45ab)
      octal (e.g. 078, -078, +078)
  - floats:
      decimal (e.g. 31, -67.421e-8, 83.456, 23.3e8)
      hexadecimal (e.g. -0xa7b6p-7)
  - bytes:
      As a hex number or as input from a file
      - The hex number is prefixed with '0x' (e.g. 0xab4b2f5e9d7f)
        NOTE: Only multiple of 8 bits possible
      - The input filename is prefixed with 'file://' (e.g. file://myfile.bin)
  - strings:
      As a string without quotes. (e.g. ThisIsAString)
      NOTE::
      gWhisper control characters ' ', ',' or ':' need to be escaped by pre-pending a ':'
  - enum values:
      As the enum value name
      Enum values are tab-completed
  - bools
      true, false, 1, 0
      Bool values are tab-completed
  - nested types:
      The nested type fields enclosed in colons. E.g. target=:field1=1 field2=2:
      Nested types are tab-completed
  - repeated fields:
      A list of field values enclosed in colons, separated with a comma and a whitespace.
      E.g. values=:2, 4, 16, 32:
      Repeated fields are tab-completed
  - map fields:
      As a repeated field with nested key, value pairs (protobuf representation of maps).
      E.g. my_map=::key=5 value=testval:, :key=40 value=anotherValue::
      Map fields are tab-completed

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
    This is a program written in a very simple formatting language. A valid program has
    the following form:
        @ (.<FieldName>)+ : ( <String> || /<FieldName>[%<Modifier>]/ )+ :
    The modifier is optional. Valid modifiers are: 'default', 'dec', 'hex' and 'raw' (binary output)
    Example:
        ./gwhisper --customOutput @.listOfDevices:Found device /device_name%default/$'\n': 127.0.0.1 discoveryService.devices GetDevices

    Output:
        Found device Mouse
        Found device Keyboard
        Found device Screen
        ...
    This will search for any number of fields with a name "listOfDevices" in the RPC reply message. For each match (multiple in case of repeated field), The string `"Found device /device_name/\n"` is printed with `/device_name/` replaced by the value of the field `"device_name"`.


EXAMPLES:
  gwhisper exampledomain.org:50059 bakery orderCookies amount=5
      Connects to the gRPC server running at exampledomain.org on TCP port 50059
      and calls the orderCookies RPC method of the bakery service.
      A request message will be passed to the RPC call with the 'amount' field
      set to 5. Other fields, which might be present, are left at default values.

  gwhisper [2001:db8::2:1]:50059 bakery orderCookies config=:chocolate=true smarties=false: amount=5
      Uses IPv6 address and nested types in the request message.

  gwhisper 192.168.0.43 bakery orderCookies amount=0xa
      Uses IPv4 address, default TCP port of 50051 and field value as hex.

  gwhisper 127.0.0.1 examples.StreamingRpcs requestStreamCountMessages :: ::
      Issues a client-streaming RPC against the example server, streaming two empty messages.

  gwhisper 127.0.0.1 examples.StreamingRpcs bidirectionalStreamNegateNumbers :number=3: :number=7:
      Issues a bi-directional streaming RPC against the example server.
      Result will be:
        number = -3
        number = -7
